feat: Task dependencies and multi-step workflows

## Problem

Can't chain tasks together (run tests after refactor, deploy after tests pass). No conditional logic or approval gates.

## Features

### Task Dependencies

- `dependsOn: [taskId]` field — task stays queued until dependencies complete
- DAG validation (no circular dependencies)
- Cascade failure (if dependency fails, dependent tasks fail too)

### Workflow Templates

- Define multi-step workflows (sequence of tasks with conditions)
- Conditions: "if previous task opened PR", "if CI passes", "if cost < $X"
- Approval gates: task pauses until a user approves

### Web UI

- Visual workflow builder (drag-and-drop DAG)
- Workflow execution view showing progress through steps

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Tasks can declare dependencies on other tasks
- [ ] Dependent tasks auto-start when dependencies complete
- [ ] Circular dependency detection
- [ ] Cascade failure on dependency failure
- [ ] Workflow template CRUD
